- **Customizable branding** and company information
- **Multiple export formats** (PDF, HTML, JSON)

### ðŸ”’ **Offline & Secure Operation**
- **No internet dependencies** - fully self-contained
- **Dark theme integration** matching Havoc's interface
- **Local data processing** with no external API calls
- **Secure report generation** within your infrastructure

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

The MITRE reporting system is built as a native Qt5 widget integrated into Havoc's interface:

```cpp
namespace HavocNamespace::UserInterface::Widgets {
    class MitreReport : public QWidget {
        // Core reporting engine
        void collectSystemMetrics();      // Real session data collection
        void mapCommandsToMitre();        // Technique mapping engine
        void generateExecutiveSummary();  // Management report generation
    };
}
```

### Data Sources

The reporting engine pulls data directly from Havoc's live session management:

- **Session Information**: `HavocX::Teamserver.Sessions`
- **System Metrics**: Hostnames, IPs, OS versions, user accounts
- **Technique Detection**: Based on agent activities and command execution
- **Timeline Data**: First seen, last seen, activity timestamps

### MITRE Technique Mapping

The system automatically maps Havoc activities to MITRE ATT&CK techniques:

| Havoc Activity | MITRE Technique | Tactic | Severity |
|----------------|-----------------|---------|----------|
| C2 Agent Deployment | T1055 - Process Injection | Defense Evasion | High |
| HTTP/HTTPS Communication | T1071.001 - Web Protocols | Command & Control | Medium |
| System Reconnaissance | T1057 - Process Discovery | Discovery | Low |
| File System Access | T1083 - File Discovery | Discovery | Low |

## Usage Guide

### Getting Started

1. **Access MITRE Report**: Navigate to the MITRE Report tab in Havoc
2. **Configure Operation**: Fill in engagement details in Configuration tab
3. **Refresh Data**: Click "Refresh Data" to pull live session information
4. **Review Analytics**: Examine metrics in the Analysis tab
5. **Generate Report**: Use "Preview Report" then export as needed

### Best Practices

- **Regular Updates**: Refresh data throughout the engagement
- **Complete Configuration**: Fill all operation details for professional output
- **Review Before Export**: Use preview function to verify report accuracy
- **Custom Branding**: Add company logos and disclaimers for client delivery

### Export Options

- **PDF Export**: Professional document for executive distribution
- **HTML Export**: Web-friendly format for online sharing
- **JSON Export**: Structured data for integration with other tools

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **Local Processing**: All report generation occurs within Havoc infrastructure
- **No External APIs**: Zero dependency on internet services
- **Session Isolation**: Reports contain only data from current engagement

### Operational Security
- **Sanitized Output**: Reports focus on techniques, not sensitive system details
